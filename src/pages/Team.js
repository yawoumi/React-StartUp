          The two of us met in college in 2020 and have been going strong ever since.
          What makes our team great ? We share common values and interests, and have created a 
          strong dynamic, which we bring in every project we tackle. We started Christoumi in 2021, 
          as a part of our Fullstack Development course. Since then, we have tried to give
          it every single bit of passion it deserves.
